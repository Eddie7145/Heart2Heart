            <p>"I just want to personally thank you very much, for first of all showing an interest in our cause and for also being willing to participate, giving what you have just to put smiles on peoples faces, faces you haven't seen and to people you don't know.
                 <br>If you've gotten to this point, I believe you know what this project is about. This project was created for the sole purpose of helping people, specifically people we don't know. I look around sometimes and see that we as individuals are often taken adrift by the various challenges we face and the vast problems that life presents, that we barely take a step back to see the blessings that life has also has presented and that's why valentine is here, a peroid where we celebrate one blessing, which is the blessing of family, of caring and loving friends, well wishers and the ones that are closest to our heart, but sometimes we neglect the ones around us, you know your next door neighbour, the begger that lives across the street, basically the people around us.
                 <br> Our focus with this project is to bring your attention back to the fact that we all need love, we need to be loved, we need to love and we also need to reciprocate such love to people who don't have someone to give them such, and that's what we stand for, the only question I have for you now is WILL YOU STAND WITH US?"
